name: circle-area
description: Compute the area of a circle given its radius using A = π r^2. Use this when asked to calculate, validate, or compare areas of circles. Includes a Python script at scripts/compute_circle_area.py that takes a radius and prints the area.
---

Quick start
- Execute the bundled script to compute the area of a circle from its radius.

Usage
- scripts/compute_circle_area.py <radius> [--precision N] [--json]

Notes
- Radius must be a non-negative real number.
- Uses math.pi for π.
- By default, prints the area as a single floating-point number. Use --precision to round or --json for structured output.
